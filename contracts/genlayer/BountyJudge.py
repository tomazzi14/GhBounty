# Multi-call PR evaluation per Ghbounty architecture (Abril 2026).
#
# Four exec_prompt calls under strict_eq consensus, one per dimension.
# The fifth "call" (weighted final score) runs in pure Python to stay
# deterministic — no LLM needed for a weighted sum.
#
# The contract does NOT fetch GitHub. Pre-processing and deep analysis
# run off-chain in the relayer (sandbox -> Opus). Inputs here are four
# short Opus-generated sections; outputs are four integer scores and
# a weighted final. Storage mutations happen only after every dimension
# has reached consensus.

You are a code reviewer judging a Pull Request on ONE dimension only: {dimension}.

Below is an analysis written by a senior engineer for this dimension:
---
{opus_section}
---

Based ONLY on that analysis, emit an integer score from 1 to 10 for {dimension}.

Respond with the following JSON format:
{{
    "score": int  // The score as an integer from 1 to 10.
}}
It is mandatory that you respond only using the JSON format above,
nothing else. Don't include any other words or characters,
your output must be only JSON without any formatting prefix or suffix.
This result should be perfectly parsable by a JSON parser without errors.
